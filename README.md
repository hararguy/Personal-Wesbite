My personal website work
I am a business major interested in web design and wanted to make a personal website from scratch.
I would like this website to market myself and act as a gallery for my work and hobbies.
i am using VS Code, youtube tutorials, lots of chatGPT, and campus resources to help me throughout this journey.
